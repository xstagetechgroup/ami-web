        "description": "We took the Samakaka cloth to Lisbon ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹. Not as an ornament, but as a symbol. A piece of our history, our identity, and the strength of Educated Women. And there, far from home, we witnessed something that deeply touched our hearts: women from other cultures embracing this fabric with charm, respect, and admiration. It was more than a giftâ€”it was a hug between continents. It was our Angola, with all its ancestry, being welcomed with beauty and reverence. Every amazed gaze before the Samakaka was like a seed carried by the wind, spreading the strength of a culture that resists, teaches, and inspires. Seeing our cloth in the hands of other women showed me that when we honor ourselves, the world learns to honor us too. The Samakaka did not speak only of usâ€”it spoke of all women who carry in their roots a story that deserves to be told, recognized, and celebrated. It was not just fabric. It was memory, strength, and dignity in the form of color. And in that moment, I understood: being an Educated Woman also means knowing how to carry with pride what makes us unique and offering it to the world as a priceless gift.",

        "description": "Bringing education into a prison means bringing words, listening, empathy, and tools for a fresh start. Because we believe that transformation does not choose a placeâ€”it begins wherever there is a soul willing to listen, to reflect, to change. For us, at the Educated Women Association, entering a prison is not just an act of visitingâ€”it is a commitment to social inclusion, to human reintegration, to the restoration of dignity. We believe that even behind bars, the mind can be freed. And when awareness awakens, a new path is born. Each person we listen to there is not just a number or a sentenceâ€”it is a story that can still be redefined. Because as long as there is life, there is a new beginning. And where there is education, there is light. To instruct is to rekindle hope. And that is why we are here.",

During the meeting, which was attended by both presidents, the main difficulties faced by the association were discussed, including structural, social, and inclusion challenges. The visit aimed not only at observation but also at opening a collaborative dialogue to, together, find concrete paths, share strengths, and unite energies in building effective and lasting solutions. We believe that when women unite with purpose and empathy, it is possible to transform realities and ensure that no woman is left behind, regardless of her physical or social condition.",
